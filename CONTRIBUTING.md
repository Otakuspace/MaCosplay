### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain MaCosplay's quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible MaCosplay
- Enable a sustainable system for MaCosplay's maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Follow the [styleguides](#styleguides)
2. After you submit your pull request, verify that all [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/) are passing

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

We follow the [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/):

- Use the present tense ("add feature" not "added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("move cursor to..." not "moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
- Consider starting the commit message with an applicable prefix:
  - `feat:` when adding a new feature
  - `fix:` when fixing a bug
  - `docs:` when adding or changing documentation
  - `style:` for changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (formatting, etc)
  - `refactor:` for code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
  - `test:` when adding or changing tests
  - `chore:` for changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

Example:

```
feat: add ability to customize cosplay character profiles

This adds a new form that allows users to customize their character profiles
with detailed information and references.

Resolves: #123
```

### JavaScript/TypeScript Styleguide

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Prefer the object spread operator (`{...anotherObj}`) to `Object.assign()`
- Inline `export`s with expressions whenever possible

  ```js
  // Use this:
  export const foo = 'bar';

  // Instead of:
  const foo = 'bar';
  export { foo };
  ```

- Place imports in the following order:
  - External imports (from packages)
  - Internal imports (from other files in the project)
  - Style imports (CSS/SCSS files)
- Use template literals instead of string concatenation

  ```js
  // Use this:
  const message = `Hello ${name}`;

  // Instead of:
  const message = 'Hello ' + name;
  ```

### Svelte Styleguide

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Keep components focused on a single responsibility
- Use reactive statements (`$:`) for derived state
- Organize your component in this order:
  - Script
  - Style
  - Template (HTML)
- Prefer slots for composition when possible
- Use named exports for components

### CSS Styleguide

- Use TailwindCSS utility classes when possible
- For custom styles, use CSS modules or component-scoped styles
- Follow the BEM naming convention if creating custom classes
